# calc1
A test project in FoxPro 2.5. 

This is calc1 v2 ( supports just the simple operations like +, -, *, / ). 
Built using FoxPro 2.5, an RDBMS developed by Microsoft.

I am following an incremental model for this project. I go on adding features and improvements as I learn new things.

crypted login system . it stores user login time ,login date, last login, logout time , total time in the database.

it is not that much good. because, it has so much issue. and i can't figure out how to remove it so i need help .






# HOW TO USE THIS
