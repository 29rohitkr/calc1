# calc1
tried to make something on foxpro 2.5 

this is calc1 v2 ( don't think of a normal calculator by just its name ). 
it is built on foxpro 2.5 which was developed by microsoft a DBMS with programming facilities . nowadays, it is outdated.

currently, i am  adding new features as i got a new idea. now, it is with a login system and soon will be with a 
crypted login system . it stores user login time ,login date, last login, logout time , total time in the database.

it is not that much good. because, it has so much issue. and i can't figure out how to remove it so i need help .
